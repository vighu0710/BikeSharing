## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. They have decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 

- Essentially, the company wants â€”

  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  - How well those variables describe the bike demands

- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, we have a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
- Have created a model with an accuracy of 81 - 84 % to predict the bike sharing demand prediction
- Based on the model following are the factors which affect the demand both +ve and -ve:
  - year(yr) **+ve**
  - workingday **+ve**
  - temperature(temp) **+ve**
  - humidity(hum) **-ve**
  - windspeed **-ve**
  - season (summer, winter) **+ve**
  - season (spring) **-ve**
  - month (september(sep))  **+ve**
  - weekday (saturday(sat)) **+ve**
  - weather situation (Light Rain/Snow, Misty) **-ve**
- The final linear equation is:
  - count = 0.2176 + 0.2307 * `yr` + 0.053 * `workingday` + 0.5126 * `temp` - 0.1524 * `hum` - 0.1801 * `windspeed` - 0.045 * `spring` + 0.0697 * `summer` + 0.1108 * `winter` + 0.0942 * `sep` + 0.0625 * `sat` - 0.2472 * `Light Rain/Snow` - 0.056 * `Misty`
